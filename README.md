#### Background

2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) is a mechanistically unique weight loss agent whose effective and toxic doses are thought to mostly overlap. Despite DNP being banned by the FDA for human consumption, there are increased reports of DNP use. Our understanding of DNP toxicity in humans comes from case reports and analyses of reports to Poison Control, which are biased to more extreme presentations, leading to a gap in our knowledge about the adverse effects of DNP at nonlethal doses and substances used to mitigate DNP toxicity. Here we use social media to investigate the dose-effect relationship and coingestants based on reported use of DNP.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of publicly available Internet posts that we collected from 2017-2018 from Internet discussion forums dedicated to the discussion of weight loss and body building. Participants were anonymous posters on these Internet forums who consented to re-use of their data as per the terms of use for each website. We used natural language processing techniques that we had previously developed to extract doses, effects, and the names of substances used from each post.
Results: We collected 661 posts across 5 online forums from 561 unique usernames. The dose most reported to be ingested was 150 mg (1-2 pills, depending on formulation), followed by 300 mg (2-3 pills). At those doses, the most commonly reported adverse effects were sweating, a sensation of warmth, profuse sweating, and yellow discoloration of secretions. Reports of thermoregulatory (sweating, feeling hot flashes or flushed) and fatigue-related symptoms were statistically significantly more frequent at reported daily doses of 150 to 300 mg than doses below 150 mg, but not more frequent between reported daily doses of 150 to 300 mg and 300 to 450 mg (post-hoc ÔÅ£2-test with Bonferroni correction). The most common coingestants were cetirizine and loratadine. When discussing DNP use, the top 4 statistically significantly comentioned substances were triiodothyronine, clenbuterol, testosterone, and trenbolone, an androgenic anabolic steroid. The effects and medications used were judged as plausible by two board-certified medical toxicologists.
Conclusions: Fatigue and increased body temperature are reported with increasing frequency at daily doses of 150 to 300 mg of DNP.
